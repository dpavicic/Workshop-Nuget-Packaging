# Introduction

This article is the first in a series about packing your .NET projects into NuGet packages. While NuGet packaging may appear straightforward initially, delving into the documentation reveals undocumented and scattered information that can make the process time-consuming and frustrating.

Throughout the series, I will try to cover and condense all the important parts into straightforward articles. So, let's dive in...

# NuGet Packages

NuGet packages are packaged .NET projects prepared for distribution and reuse. They encapsulate code and other resources, making sharing and managing external dependencies within .NET projects easier. A NuGet package is essentially a ZIP archive with a `.nupkg` extension.

Creating and publishing your own NuGet package is an excellent method for distributing and reusing your .NET libraries. Once built, you can release it to your personal or company's repository or even an official [NuGet.org](http://NuGet.org) repository that benefits the entire .NET community.
